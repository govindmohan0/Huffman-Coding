# Huffman Coding Compression and Decompression

## Overview
This program demonstrates file compression and decompression using the Huffman coding algorithm in Python.

## Features
- **Compression**: Compresses a text file using the Huffman coding algorithm.
- **Decompression**: Decompresses the compressed binary file back to its original text format.

## How it works

### Compression
1. Reads the input text file to be compressed.
2. Calculates the frequency of each character in the text.
3. Builds a Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
4. Generates Huffman codes for each character.
5. Encodes the input text using the generated Huffman codes.
6. Pads the encoded text to ensure its length is a multiple of 8.
7. Converts the padded binary text into a byte array.
8. Writes the byte array into a binary file.

### Decompression
1. Reads the compressed binary file.
2. Converts the binary file into a bit string.
3. Removes padding from the bit string.
4. Decodes the bit string using the Huffman tree.
5. Writes the decoded text into an output text file.

## Usage
1. Open and run `Huffmancoding.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Enter the path of the text file you wish to compress.
3. The program will generate a compressed binary file with extension `.bin`.
4. The program will also decompress the `.bin` file and create a `_decompressed.txt` file with the original content.

## Example
Consider a file named `input.txt` with the text `"hello world"`:
1. Run the program and input the path of `input.txt`.
2. The program will compress `input.txt` into `input.bin`.
3. It will also generate `input_decompressed.txt` from the compressed `.bin` file.
4. The content of `input_decompressed.txt` will be identical to the original, `"hello world"`.
